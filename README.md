# Regression
In this repositery i am going to upload few notebboks on different types on Regression analysis
* Simple linear regression
* Multiple linear regression
* Polynomial regression
* SVM Regression
* Decission tree regression
* Random Forest regression

**Linear regression have few assumptions.Before proceeding forward we need to make sure the data is met with assumptions**
1. Linearity : There should be a linear relation between independent varibles and dependent varibles
2. Homoscedaticity : Residuals should be normally distrubuted and should have equal variance
3. No Endogeneity : Residuals and independent variables should be correlated
4. No Autocorrelation : There should be no correlation in residual terms
5. No MultiCollinearity : Independent varibles should not be correlated

***If the assumptions are not met we could transform the data or we could use non-linear regression model***

### Non-linear regression
* Polynomial regression
